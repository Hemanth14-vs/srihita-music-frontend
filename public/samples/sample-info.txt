Sample Audio Files for Music Streaming Platform

These are placeholder audio files for development and testing purposes.

For production deployment, replace with actual licensed audio content.

Sample files should be:
- sample-1.mp3 (30 seconds, suitable for testing playback)
- sample-2.mp3 (30 seconds, different from sample-1)

Note: Due to file size constraints, actual audio files are not included in this scaffold.
For development, you can:
1. Add your own MP3 files here
2. Use online sample audio generators
3. Record your own test audio clips

All audio content should comply with licensing requirements for your deployment environment.
