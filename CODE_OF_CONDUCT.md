# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
Music Streaming Platform project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community and project success

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Academic Integrity Standards

As this is an academic project, we also commit to:

### Original Work
* All code contributions must be original work by team members
* Properly attribute any external resources, libraries, or inspiration
* Disclose any use of AI assistance tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
* Avoid plagiarism in code, documentation, and design

### Fair Collaboration
* Ensure equal contribution from all team members
* Share knowledge and help teammates learn
* Rotate leadership responsibilities
* Document individual contributions accurately

### Honest Communication
* Report actual hours worked, not inflated estimates
* Acknowledge when you need help or are struggling
* Give credit where credit is due
* Communicate challenges early rather than hiding them

### Quality Standards
* Write clean, well-documented code
* Follow established coding standards and conventions
* Participate actively in code reviews
* Take responsibility for testing your own contributions

## Team Responsibilities

### For Team Members
* **Respect**: Treat all team members with respect and professionalism
* **Communication**: Communicate clearly and promptly about progress and blockers
* **Reliability**: Meet deadlines and commitments made to the team
* **Quality**: Maintain high standards in all work contributions
* **Learning**: Be open to feedback and continuous improvement

### For Team Leaders
* **Facilitation**: Ensure all voices are heard in team discussions
* **Support**: Provide help and resources when team members struggle

### For Code Reviewers

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Team leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Team leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.
Examples of representing our project include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This also applies to:
* GitHub repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Team meetings (in-person or virtual)
* Communication channels (Slack, Discord, email)
* Academic presentations and demos
* Faculty interactions related to the project

## Conflict Resolution

### Step 1: Direct Communication
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, first try to address it
directly with the person involved, if you feel safe doing so.

### Step 2: Team Mediation
If direct communication doesn't resolve the issue, bring it to the team
leaders or the full team for discussion and mediation.

### Step 3: Academic Escalation
For serious issues or if team-level resolution fails, involve your course
instructor or academic advisor.

### Step 4: Institutional Resources
For severe violations, utilize your institution's student conduct or
academic integrity processes.
